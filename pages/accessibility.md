# Accessability

## Introduction

The EU Accessibility Directive and the resulting national legislation, Digital Services Act, requires that authorities such as Business Finland ensures that its websites, digital services and mobile apps will meet common accessibility standards. The Act on the Provision of Digital Services entered into force on April 1, 2019. Advisory and monitoring of accessibility requirements is the responsibility of the Regional Administration of Southern Finland (AVI). 

*All new digital services in Business Finland must meet the accessibility requirements by September 23, 2020*. 

Therefore, as part of the project deliverables, the development team (BF partner, contractor, sub-contractor, BF staff) must indicate to what extent the service (deliverable) meets or differs from the accessibility requirements, i.e. WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines e.g. http://papunet.net/saavutettavuus/verkkosisallon-saavutettavuusohjeet-wcag. 

Moreover, development team must be able to identify which parts of the deliverable (website, online service, application) do not meet the A and AA criteria and why.

## What is accessibility

Promoting EU’s accessibility directive is an essential part of the digitalisation of public services. 

Accessibility refers to the fact that web pages and mobile applications, and their content, are accessible to anyone and can understand what they say (Design for All or Universal Design).

The accessible web page also allows that it can be used with advanced interfaces such as voice control (e.g. Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, etc.) in future.

There are three aspects to consider when designing and implementing an online service: 

### Technical accessibility (implementation) 

* The source code of a technically well implemented web service is error free and logical. 
* The HTML standard and WCAG guidelines have been followed and the service works well with a variety of terminals and assistive technologies such as voice control and screen reader software. 

### Ease of use 

* Ease of use means the web service is easy to visualize, navigation is clear and the page, function or content you are looking for is easy to find. 
* Navigation should not be too multilevel and the page names should be descriptive and clear 
* The main content is clearly distinguishable from other elements of the page. It is easy for the service to perform the desired function. 

### Content clarity and comprehensibility 

* Content comprehensibility is important to all users and an essential part of the accessible online service. 
* It means using clear, comprehensible language and also plain language. 
* The text should be easy to read and structured into short paragraphs and lists. Sufficient descriptive subheadings should be used. 
* Link text should also be descriptive and understandable. 
* Understandability also includes the idea of ​​multichannel: content is also provided, for example, in the form of video, images and audio in addition to text.
