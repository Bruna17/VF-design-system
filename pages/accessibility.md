#Accessability

##Introduction

All new digital services in Business Finland must meet the accessibility requirements by September 23, 2019. 

Therefore, as part of the project deliverables, the development team (BF partner, contractor, sub-contractor, BF staff) must indicate to what extent the service (deliverable) meets or differs from the accessibility requirements, i.e. WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines e.g. http://papunet.net/saavutettavuus/verkkosisallon-saavutettavuusohjeet-wcag. 

Moreover, development team must be able to identify which parts of the deliverable (website, online service, application) do not meet the A and AA criteria and why.
