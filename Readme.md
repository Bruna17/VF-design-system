TODO:

- Remove Pages.json
- Push to git

Limitations:

- Navigation is in alphabetic order
- A11Y plugin checks the whole page instead of component, so if the styleguide has A11Y problems, it will show it.
- Live reload doesn't affect A11Y. You have to manually refresh the page to start A11Y check again.
